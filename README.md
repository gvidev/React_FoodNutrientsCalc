# React_FoodNutrientsCalc
 Application made with React (Vite-build tool) with user-friendly interface with help of Semantic UI. The app can be used for calculating nutrients for many foods added into a table. Also has the functionallity to add new foods and their specifications and handle live search. It works with API which handles HTTP requests and  database lookups. For the backend I use Java Spring Boot and H2 Database.
